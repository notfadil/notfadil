# Hello, World! I'm Fadil  

## ➤ About Me  
I'm a **Recent Graduate** from the **University of Waterloo**, deeply fascinated by **data** in all its forms—whether in **Finance, Energy**, or even **Business**.  

I am currently a **Data Consultant Intern at Vosyn Inc.**, an AI startup working on **real-time video-to-video translation**. Previously, I was a **Software Engineer at HP Inc.**, and I’m always looking for ways to apply **data-driven insights** to solve real-world problems.  

My interests span across **Large Language Models, Data Orchestration, Data Visualization, Financial Modeling, and even Geography**. If there’s a story hidden in data, I want to uncover it.

## ⚡ What I’m Working On  
- ✦ Conducting research on **DeepSeek models** for language translation and benchmarking them against **LLaMA/OpenAI** models.  
- ✦ Building and automating workflows with **Apache Airflow and cloud-based solutions**.

## ⏳ Beyond Data  
When I’m not immersed in machine learning and data analytics, I enjoy:  
- ► Training and watching **combat sports**  (Fun Fact: I have learned 4 different martial arts! )
- ► Playing **badminton**  
- ► Keeping up with the latest in **football (soccer)**  

I'm always open to discussions, new ideas, and collaborations. Thanks for stopping by!
